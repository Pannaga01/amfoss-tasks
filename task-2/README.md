# Task2 (Programming):
This task consists of hackerrank and codeforces problems whcih are solved using our basic knowledge on programming. We had programmed with the language of our choice. I used python which was taught in workhop and my prior knowledge of flowgorithms to get the logics for cracking the problems.

## Process: 
Step1: Understood the problem. 

Step2: Tried to workout the logic through flowgorithm or workshop takeawyas. 
      
       1.1 Stair case problem: We worked out the problem in flowgorithms. We were taught the concept of 'nested loops' in workshop.
       
       1.2 Birthday cake candles: We were taught how to enter a 'list' in workshop. I learnt the use of 'counter' in flowgorithms.
      
       1.3 Triplets: I learnt the concept of 'loops' through flowgorithms. I used 'if' condition in this problem. 

Step3: Watched YouTube videos for understanding the approach to the solution(if required)
 
       3.1 Stair case problem: As we were taught pattern printing in class, I didn't have to watch any videos for it.
       
       3.2 Birthday cake candle: I worked out the problem myself. I referred to a video to check if my approach was right (list and count)            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bqurNP1AnQ
       
       3.3 Triplets: In this problem, I just knew the usage of 'if' codition. I had to watch a video for the approach. i tried to                      understand the program written. I had to do research about 'Return'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tafbg1T0AYQ&t=224s
       
Step4: Writing the program in codechef. (The codes written are in the folder of task2)
