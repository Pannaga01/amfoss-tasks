# Caesar Cipher task:
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. I did the task in c program. 
## Process:
Step1: Read the task in cs50. Watched the video of CS50 regarding it. I learnt the steps involved:

     1.1 To get the key: 'argc' which takes in an integer(the number of arguments) and 'argv' which takes a string (list of               arguments). a to i converts string to integer. it uses ASCII format. Learnt about alphabetical index.
     1.2 get the plaintext: I learnt to give a 'string' in c program. 
     1.3 encipher: I learnt writing boolean expressions in c program. Boolean is used to preserve the case. formula: c=(p+k)%26. I learnt how this formula is used. 
        
Step2: Watched videos related to caesar coding for reference. I tried to understand the program. All of them didn't have the same           programme. The way the conditions were presented and the boolean expressions were given was different. So, I had to understand what is common with all of them and the purpose served by that particular command.

Step3: I produced my understanding and wrote a program. (My program is in the folder caesar)
