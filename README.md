# amfoss-tasks
This repository contains the details about the amfoss-tasks. It explains my approach to the task and the way implemented it. It gives a clear picture on my journey in this path and a thorough understanding on my learning. 

## list of amfoss-tasks
Task1: Starring the repositories.

Task2: https://github.com/Pannaga01/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-2

Task10: https://github.com/Pannaga01/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task10%20CS50

## Introspection:
I think I deserve to be chosen because I am committed to my work. I work sincrely. I try not to give up. Though I have not done all the tasks, I have worked for every task I did. I tried my level best to perform in the tasks and worked from the scratch as I do not have any computer science background. At the first, when I read a task, I panick and get anxious about it as I am clueless about it. But when I go through the description, watch videos and break the question into parts and search bit by bit, things start making sense. And I guess I have gathered confidence now. 

In the process of doing the tasks, apart from the learning I had, I developed few skills that are required for me later in life. I developed research skills(the entire project is based on our research) and I learnt time management(my assignmens, workshop and the tasks). I learnt to become patient(as i was not getting the required results most of the times). Going a bit humorous, I am a movie buff and my YouTube recommendations are always a movie interview or an  audio launch, but now it is CS50-lecture 1 and c progarm tutorials. Instead of greeting my friend "Good Morning", I ask "have you completed the CS50 task?". My mentor's words are an inspiration for me- You have to work to get something. So, I woud like to work my best for anything I would do in future. 

In my opinion, there are students who have prior-knowledge in programming and there are students who are absolutely new to computer science. If both are given the same tasks, it would be tougher for the students who do not have any CS background. You have to also consider the fact that the tasks are tough and completely new to us. 

I do not have any plan as such. I should get adjusted to the education system, cirruculum and exam patterns here.

I think I can contribute to the club by giving my time and putting my efforts.
